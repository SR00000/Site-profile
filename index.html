    <h1>Welcome to my full stack development portfolio</h1>
    <h2>What is Full Stack development?</h2>
    <p>A Full Stack Developer utilizes a combination of Front end languages for user experience, back end development for overall design and function for app operation, and database creation and management. This skill set provides a complete solution for the creation and implementation of web/app development.</p>

    <h2>Why are Full Stack Developers a required asset on your team?</h2>
    <p>Full Stack Developers play a vital role in streamlining your project and bringing it to fruition. Typically a developer would come on at the beginning of your project to help convert user requirements into a design plan for your intended use of a web application. This process usually requires the involvment of non-technical teams and key groups within the firm, working in concert with the developer to achieve the end product.</p>

    <h2>What are the pitfalls of not having a Full Stack Developer on your team?</h2>
    <p>Short answer... a huge <strong>waste of money</strong> as well as potential <strong>delays to project completion</strong>.</p>
    <p>Without a FS Developer on your team who can put together and visualize all the key elements of your web application, mistakes and miscommunications will occur which will decrease the overall efficiency of your team, as well as the quality of the end product. This situation can easily lead to a much higher investment in your web application, and delay bringing your application to market, potentially harming your business in this competitive atmosphere.</p>

    <h2>Are you ready for the future?</h2>
    <p>Taking into consideration the technological competitiveness in todays business world built on web 2.0, and the cutting edge of tech being worked on for web 3.0 (which is just on the horizon), does your company have the developers it needs to stay ahead? I can make that happen, <a href="mailto:raftaris@alumni.vcu.edu?subject=Proposal">email me</a></p><br>
